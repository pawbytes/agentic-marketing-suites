# Agentic Marketing Suite

A modular suite of Claude Code skills for full-stack marketing — from strategic planning through channel execution, measurement, and automation. Each skill is a specialist that can be invoked independently or routed to by the agency coordinator.

## Installation

Install all skills into your project with one command:

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing
```

Or install globally (available in every project):

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --global
```

Install a specific skill only:

```bash
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --skill marketing-sostac
npx skills add gnoviawan/agentic-marketing --skill marketing-seo
```

> Skills are installed to `.claude/skills/` in your project, or `~/.claude/skills/` globally. Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## Quick Start

Once installed, invoke skills from Claude Code:

```
/marketing-agency    — Start here for any marketing task (routes to specialists)
/marketing-sostac    — Build a full SOSTAC marketing plan
/marketing-seo       — SEO audit, keyword research, content optimization
/marketing-email     — Email sequences, drip campaigns, newsletters, cold outbound
/marketing-paid-ads  — Google Ads, Meta Ads, campaign setup
/marketing-cro       — Landing pages, signup flows, conversion optimization
/marketing-launch    — Product launch strategy and go-to-market
/marketing-retention — Churn reduction, cancel flows, win-back campaigns
```

## Documentation

Use the docs for workflow guidance, brand workspace conventions, and a page for every skill:

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — docs home
- [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) — where to start and what to prepare
- [`docs/workflows/new-brand-onboarding.md`](docs/workflows/new-brand-onboarding.md)
- [`docs/workflows/sostac-planning.md`](docs/workflows/sostac-planning.md)
- [`docs/workflows/implementation-after-sostac.md`](docs/workflows/implementation-after-sostac.md)
- [`docs/workflows/quick-task-without-full-plan.md`](docs/workflows/quick-task-without-full-plan.md)
- [`docs/reference/brand-workspace.md`](docs/reference/brand-workspace.md)
- [`docs/reference/deliverables-and-file-locations.md`](docs/reference/deliverables-and-file-locations.md)
- [`docs/skills/`](docs/skills/) — one page per skill

If you're new to the suite, the recommended path is:
1. Start with [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md)
2. Use `/marketing-agency` to select or create a brand
3. Run `/marketing-sostac` if strategy is missing
4. Create `/product-marketing-context` before scaling content and campaigns
5. Move into the specialist skills for execution

## Skills Reference

### Entry Point

#### `marketing-agency`
Digital marketing agency coordinator. The recommended starting point for any marketing task. Routes to the right specialist based on what you need — planning, channel execution, measurement, or creative. Use when working on any marketing task for a brand, even if you know which channel you want; the coordinator provides context and continuity across skills.

---

### Strategy

#### `marketing-sostac`
Full SOSTAC marketing plan builder. Researches first, then delivers strategic recommendations for each phase — validated with the user rather than discovered through interview. Every phase follows a **Research → Recommend → Validate** sequence. Outputs are saved to `brands/{brand-slug}/sostac/`.

| Phase | What happens | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0 — Auto-Discovery | Automated web research before first user interaction | `00-auto-discovery.md` |
| 1 — Situation | Competitive analysis and market research; user validates | `01-situation.md` |
| 2 — Objectives | Benchmarked OKR/KPI recommendations; user refines | `02-objectives.md` |
| 3 — Strategy | Positioning and channel strategy; user confirms | `03-strategy.md` |
| 4 — Tactics | Channel-level execution plan; user adjusts priorities | `04-tactics.md` |
| 5 — Action | Roled roadmap and ownership; user finalizes | `05-action.md` |
| 6 — Control | KPI dashboards and review cadences | `06-control.md` |

Frameworks: SWOT+TOWS, PESTLE, Porter's Five Forces, TAM/SAM/SOM, JTBD, OKR, RACE, STP, Ansoff, positioning statement, AARRR, ICE scoring, 7P, RACI, PDCA, Balanced Scorecard, Blue Ocean, Kotter change model, and more — 38 individual framework files indexed in `frameworks-index.csv`.

## Brand Workspaces

All brand-specific work lives in `brands/{brand-slug}/` and is **gitignored** — client data never enters version control.

```
brands/{brand-slug}/
├── brand-context.md             # Core brand info, tone, positioning
├── research-*.md                # Research files
└── sostac/                      # SOSTAC plan (created by marketing-sostac)
    ├── README.md                # Phase completion tracker
    ├── 00-auto-discovery.md     # Pre-interview research
    ├── 01-situation.md
    ├── 02-objectives.md
    ├── 03-strategy.md
    ├── 04-tactics.md
    ├── 05-action.md
    ├── 06-control.md
    └── plan-summary.md          # Executive summary (after all 6 phases)
```

## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent layout:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Instructions loaded into Claude's context
└── references/
    ├── frameworks-index.csv    # Lightweight index of all framework files (~10–40 rows)
    ├── frameworks/             # Individual framework files (one per methodology)
    │   ├── framework-a.md
    │   └── framework-b.md
    ├── shared-patterns.md      # Shared context-router and pre-flight patterns
    ├── best-practices.md       # Execution best practices
    └── *.md                    # Additional domain-specific references
```

Skills use **progressive disclosure** — only `SKILL.md` loads into context when the skill is active. Reference files are read on demand using a CSV-indexed lookup:

1. Read `frameworks-index.csv` (~10–40 rows) — lightweight index with a `best_for` column
2. Match the user's situation to the index
3. Read only the matched framework file(s) from `frameworks/`

This reduces token consumption by 80–90% per framework lookup compared to loading a single monolithic file. Individual framework files are preserved for rollback in skills that had them.

## Adding a New Brand

1. Create `brands/{brand-slug}/brand-context.md` with the brand's core information
2. Run `/marketing-sostac` and tell it the brand slug — it will handle the rest
3. Brand files are local only (gitignored); back them up separately if needed

---

## Contributing

Skills are plain Markdown — edit any `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` or its `references/` files directly. The format follows the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).
