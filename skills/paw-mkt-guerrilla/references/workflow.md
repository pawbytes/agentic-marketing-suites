# Workflow & Deliverables

> Standard workflow, outputs, file organization, and response protocol for guerrilla marketing work.

---

## 1. Response Protocol

When the user requests guerrilla marketing or growth hacking work:

1. **Read brand context and SOSTAC** when available, then continue from the best available context.
2. **Clarify scope**: Budget guerrilla tactics, viral campaign, competitive disruption, growth experiments, referral program, or full guerrilla strategy?
3. **Assess risk tolerance**: Conservative brands need lower-risk tactics. Challenger brands can push boundaries. Ask if unclear.
4. **Assess current state**: Check the resolved path for prior work.
5. **Deliver actionable output**: Specific campaigns, experiment plans, stunt briefs, competitive analyses -- never vague inspiration. Every deliverable includes a risk assessment.
6. **Save deliverables**: Write all outputs to the resolved path.
7. **Recommend the first move**: What to execute first, what to test, and what to measure.

## 3. File Organization

```
# Campaign mode:
./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/guerrilla/
  guerrilla-strategy-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
  campaign-concept-{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
  stunt-brief-{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
  competitive-disruption-{competitor}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
  growth-experiments/
  referral-program/
  performance/

# Standalone mode:
./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/operations/guerrilla/
  (same structure as above)
```

---

## 4. Path Resolution

**Campaign mode** - working within a named campaign:
- Save to `./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/guerrilla/`
- Read campaign strategy at `./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/{type}-{campaign-slug}/strategy.md`

**Standalone mode** - evergreen or independent work:
- Save to `./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/operations/guerrilla/`

**Legacy fallback** - old directory structure detected:
- Save to `./.pawbytes/marketing-suites/brands/{brand-slug}/campaigns/guerrilla/`
- Suggest migration to new structure

If unsure which mode, ask: "Is this part of a specific campaign, or standalone work?"

---

## 5. Output Contract

Guerrilla marketing deliverables include:

- **Tactic type**: growth hack, viral campaign, competitive disruption, stunt, or experiment
- **Objective**: what specific outcome the tactic targets
- **Execution plan**: step-by-step implementation with timeline
- **Risk assessment**: potential downsides and mitigation strategies
- **Budget**: estimated cost (including zero-budget options)
- **Success metrics**: how to measure if the tactic worked
- **File saved to**: path where the deliverable was written
